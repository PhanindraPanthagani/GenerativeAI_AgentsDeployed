# GenerativeAI-Building-AI-agents

## Generative AI Agents, built for production.

A practical, open-source playbook for building reliable AI agents with LLMs ,  from prompts → tools → workflows → evals → deployment.

This repository contains end-to-end examples of agentic systems: tool-using LLMs that can plan, reason, call APIs, search documents, follow guardrails, and produce repeatable outputs. The focus is on production-minded patterns: observability, evaluation, safety, and modular design.
